This repository contains all evaluation results of the No Target Function Classifier stored as CSV files.
Benchmarks were performed for the reuters21578 benchmark [1], the MAUI citeulike180 benchmark [2], and a self-compiled corpus of 925 scientific documents taken from the Cornell University Library arXiv.org digital library [3].
 
Each benchmark is in its own directory. Benchmarks for assignment of the top n (n in set {1,2,3,5}) categories per document have been performed.
